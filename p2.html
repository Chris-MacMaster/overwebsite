    <h2>Hero Form</h2>
    <p id="hero-description">Heroes can be grouped according to categories, with some heroes belonging to multiple groups. The groups are pick-based, pressure-based,
        and ultimate-based. The names describe how each group gets its value, or in other words wins games. Pick-based heroes get pickoffs, meaning
        they eliminate an enemy hero before both teams engage in full. They essentially win the fight before the fight. Pressure-based heroes do the
        opposite, overwhelming the enemies resources with either damage or abilities to win the fight after both teams engage in full. Lastly, ultimate
        based heroes primarily rely on dealing damage to charge up their unique ultimate ability, then win fights by properly utilizing that ultimate.

    <p id="form-description">Picking your first hero to learn the game is easier if in advance you decide on your preferred playstyle, figure out your level of skill, and
        decide on your favorite weapons. The form below provides a framework for jotting down such factors.</p>
